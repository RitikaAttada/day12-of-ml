## 🌱 Day 12 of My Machine Learning Journey

### 🧠 What I Did Today:

✅ Practiced **multivariate regression with 3 inputs** using a custom dataset
✅ Learned to use **MinMaxScaler** and **joblib** to scale & save data
✅ Built a clean, reusable **`rent()` prediction function**
✅ Visualized model predictions vs actuals
✅ Predicted on 5 different custom datasets
✅ Understood how **noise** affects prediction accuracy

### 📊 Datasets Practiced:

1. 🏠 House Rent → inputs: size, rooms, distance → rent ₹
2. 📚 Student Scores → inputs: study hrs, sleep hrs, attendance → score
3. 🚗 Car Price → inputs: age, mileage, engine → price in ₹ L
4. 🌾 Crop Yield → inputs: rainfall, temp, pH → yield in kg
5. 👩‍💼 Employee Salary → inputs: experience, certifications, rating → salary in ₹ LPA

### 🧩 Key Concepts Mastered:

* Double brackets for Keras input ✅
* Why and how to scale inputs using **MinMaxScaler**
* How to **save/load** scalers with **joblib**
* How to **denormalize predictions** back to original units
* Realized that **noise in data** can affect prediction quality

### 🔥 What’s Next:

⏭️ Try 4-input regression
⏭️ Practice with real Kaggle datasets
⏭️ Experiment with less noisy data for better accuracy
⏭️ Save model + scaler together and deploy as a mini tool
